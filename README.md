## Considerations

* Place behind window to avoid dealing with weather issues.
* Place close to window surrounded by black fabric to minimize
  reflection in window and ambient lighting.
* Avoid using tape to place camera.
* Needs software alarm to detect if camera has is face down or have been
  moved. Also check time of day.
* Focus on mornings and afternoons.
* Needs monitoring to detect if syncing has stopped or device has become
  unavailable.
* Camera should be hung from the top of the window or ceiling.

## Problems
* Unable to rotate image on-the-fly. Camera needs to be oriented
  top-down (vertical and horizontal flip possible).
* Need hi-quality Wifi Dongle, connectivity to file-system while
  capturing is very slow (Solved).

## Adjustable Parameters
* Exposure
* Shutter Speed
* White Balance
